Capo 4

A
       A              D               A                 D
On the morning when I woke up without you for the first time
       A               E                 A
I felt free and I felt lonely and I felt scared


    A          D              F#m              D
And I began to talk to myself almost immediately
          A       E         D           E
Not being used to being the only person there


    A                 D               A                      D
The first time I made coffee for just myself I made too much of it
               A                  E              D                A
But I drank it all just cause you hate it when I let things go to waste

      A                    D                   F#m             D
And I wandered through the house like a little boy lost at the mall
       A                    E               D               E
And an astronaut could have seen the hunger in my eyes from space

            A             E             D             A
And I sang, oh, what do I do? What do I do? What do I do?
          E          A
What do I do without you?

      A                 D               A                 D
On the morning I when I woke up without you for the first time
      A                   E           D               A
I was cold, so I put on a sweater and I turned up the heat

       A               D              F#m             D
And the walls began to close in and I felt so sad and frightened
              A            E           D            A
I practically ran from the living room out into the street

        A             D                A              D
And the wind began to blow and all the trees began to bend
        A                 E                  A
And the world in its cold way started coming alive

      A                  D           F#m           D
And I stood there like a businessman waiting for a train
          A             E         A
And I got ready for the future to arrive

            A             E             D             A
And I sang, oh, what do I do? What do I do? What do I do?
          E          A
What do I do without you?
