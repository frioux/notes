           <h1>AJJ - People Ii The Reckoning</h1>
<pre><code>[Intro]

       Am, C, G, F (use your &quot;pinky finger&quot; for each chord; listen to the song)
       Am, C, G, F (hold on F for 8 measures second time)


[Verse]

(Note:don't do the &quot;pinky thing&quot; for the singing parts)

Am
Nobody knows everything
       G
We know this to be true
F
Everything is difficult
            C             G
Except what's in front of you
Am                                    G
But it's complicated even under your nose
F
Bullshit math equations
         C               G
And your highs and your lows
         Am
And your manic depression
    G
It comes and it goes
         F
Your parasympathetic nervous system reacts
        C      G
And you're in fight-or-flight mode

Am, C, G, F (Note: &quot;pinky thing&quot;)
Am, C, G, F (hold F for 4 measures second time)


[Verse] (same chords as 1st verse)

 Am                                        G
How's the world so small when the world is so large?
 F                                       C                  G
And what made the world, could I please speak to who's in charge?
 Am                           G
Everything is real but it's also just as fake
  F                                            C          G
From your daughter's birthday party to your grandmother's wake
 Am                        G
And your bi-polar illness, it comes and it goes
            F
Your parasympathetic nervous system reacts
     C          G
And you're in fight or flight
   C             F
You're in fight or flight
    C            G
You're in fight or flight mode


 Am, C, G, F (Note: &quot;pinky thing&quot;)
 Am, C, G, F (hold on F for 8 measures second time)


[Verse](same chords as 1st verse)

Am                                     G
I've tried to know which words to sing so many times
   F
And I've tried to know which chords to play
 C                         G
And I've tried to make it rhyme
   Am                                G
And I've tried to find the key that all good songs are in
F                                                     C          G
And I've tried to find the notes to make that great resounding din
Am
But there's a bad man in everyone
 G
No matter who we are
F                                  C              G
There's a rapist and a Nazi living in our tiny hearts
  Am                                G
Child pornographers and cannibals, and politicians too
 F                                        C       G
There's someone in your head waiting to fucking strangle you

Am
So here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
 C                             Am             G
People love you more, oh never mind, oh never mind
             Am
In fucking fact, Mrs. Robinson
        C                                Am           G
The world won't care whether you live or die, live or die
             Am
In fucking fact, Mrs. Robinson,
          C                           Am                G
They probably hate to see your stupid face, your stupid face
              Am
So here's to you, Mrs. Robinson,
C                          Am, C, G, F
You live in an unforgiving place.

Am, C, G, F (hold F for 8 measures 2nd time)
