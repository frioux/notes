           <h1>Bob Dylan - If You See Her Say Hello</h1>
<pre><code>Words and music Bob Dylan
Recorded in New York, Sept 16th 1974 (released on the Bootleg Series 1-3, 1991)
and in Minneapolis Dec 30 1974 (released on Blood on the Tracks, 1975)
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem
Blood on the Tracks version

Capo 2nd fret (sounding key D major)

At the C/g in the last line the 2nd guitar plays a very pronounced b, which gives
the chord a strong Cmaj7'ish flavor.

C               F      C       G              C      [Bass run: G-A-C]
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier
C                   F     C                          Bb . . . G
 She left here last early spring, is livin' there, I hear
Am               F       C                               F
 Say for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow
          Am                 C/G               F                C
She might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so.

              We had...

C               F      C       G              C
We had a falling-out, like lovers often will
C                   F     C                          Bb . . . G
And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill
Am               F       C                               F
And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart
          Am                 C/G               F                C
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.


C               F      C       G              C
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me
C                   F     C                          Bb . . . G
I always have respected her for doin' what she did and gettin' free
Am               F       C                               F
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way.
          Am                 C/G               F                C
Oh, the bitter taste still lingers on,
from that night I tried to make her stay.


C               F      C       G              C
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
C                   F     C                          Bb . . . G
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
Am               F       C                               F
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off
          Am                 C/G               F                C
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft.


C               F      C       G              C
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past
C                   F     C                          Bb . . . G
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast
Am               F       C                               F
If she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find
          Am                 C/G               F                C
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
