Tabbed By: Clayton

[Verse]
       A           A/C#  F#m  E
If you hate the taste of wine
           A        A/C#        F#m   E
Why do you drink it till you're blind?
         A              A/C#       D               E
And if you swear that there's no truth and who cares
             F#m                  E
How come you say it like you're right?

            A         A/C#     F#m E
Why are you scared to dream of God
              A     A/C#     F#m  E
When it's salvation that you want?
          A         A/C#             D        E
You see, stars that clear have been dead for years
        F#m             E
But the idea just lives on

       A           A/C# F#m   E
In our wheels that roll around
      A     A/C#    F#m  E
As we move over the ground
        A      A/C#             D      E
And all day it seems we've been in between
  F#m              E
A past and future town

[Chorus]
       F#m              E
We are nowhere and it's now
       F#m              E
We are nowhere and it's now
          D                       E
An like a ten-minute dream in the passenger seat
          A         E      Asus2/C#
While the world was flying by
               E                     E7
I haven't been gone very long but it feels like a lifetime

A  F#m  A  A/C#  A  F#m  A  A/C#  E  E7  E  E7


[Bridge]
Bm                    E
I've been sleeping so strange at night
Bm                      E
Side effects they don't advertise
Bm                    E
I've been sleeping so strange
Bm                  E
With a head full of pesticide

A  A/C#  F#m  E  A  A/C#  F#m  E

[Verse]
            A         A/C#     F#m  E
I've got no plans and too much time
        A           A/C# F#m  E
I feel too restless to unwind
           A       A/C#         D        E
I'm always lost in thought as I walk a block
      F#m            E
To my favorite neon sign

          A        A/C#      F#m   E
Where the waitress looks concerned
       A      A/C#   F#m  E
But she never says a word
              A        A/C#       D    E
Just turns the jukebox on and we hum along
      F#m            E
And I smile back at her

       A            A/C#  F#m  E
And my friend comes after work
         A        A/C#     F#m  E
When the features start to blur
               A        A/C#          D           E
She says these bars are filled with things that kill
           F#m                    E
By now you probably should have learned

[Chorus]
           F#m              E
Did you forget that yellow bird?
                 F#m             E
How could you forget your yellow bird?
               D
And she took a small silver wreath and
       E
pinned it onto me
          A            E         Asus2/C#
She said this one will bring you love
            E                       E7
And I don't know if it's true but I keep it for good luck

[Outro]
A  F#m  A  A/C#  A  F#m  A  A/C#
A  F#m  A  A/C#  A  F#m  A  A/C#  A
