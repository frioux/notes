</ul>
<h4 id="prairie-breeze-cheddar-2021-05-08">Prairie Breeze Cheddar (2021-05-08)</h4>
<p>5/5 Stars: Would definitely have again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sweeter than your typical cheddar with lots of flavor, crumbly yet creamy
with a little crunch from the calcium crystals developed during the aging
process.  This American artisan cheese, made in the Midwest might surprise
you, a great cheese that you deserve to try.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="hooks-10-year-old-cheddar-2021-05-08">Hook's 10 year old Cheddar (2021-05-08)</h4>
<p>3/5 Stars: A great cheese, but not something I'd want to have often.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tony and Julie Hook make some of America's oldest Cheddars in Mineral Point,
WI. They have a cheese cave carved into the side of a hill and they like to
keep their cheeses extremely moist.  All of the milk for their cheese comes
from a carefully selected group of 25 small family farms in the rural area
surrounding Mineral Point.  Tony personally delives product to area
resaurants, and every Saturday from spring through fall the couple can be
found manning their busy booth at Madison's renowned Dane County Farmers
Market.  The 10 year is fairly intense with those delicious little crystals
throughout.</p>

<h4 id="farmdal-2021-05-08">Farmdal (2021-05-08)</h4>
<p>4/5 Stars: Very good, middle of the road cheddar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Produced by Old Groendal dairy in West Flanders.  Farmdal is a young (5mo)
Gouda produced with the same milk as the amazing OG Kristal.  You can
definitely tell it's the same milk, but this version is much softer,
creamier, with nice vanilla notes and a touch of funky acidity on the finish.</p>
