      Gm
Well, guy in a skeleton costume
Bb                         Eb
Comes up to the guy in the Superman suit
                        Gm
Runs through him with a broadsword

I flipped the television off
      Bb                    Eb
Bring all the bright lights up
               Gm
Turn the radio up loud
C
 I don't know why I'm so persuaded
F
 That if I think things through
Eb
Long enough and hard enough
D
 I'll somehow get to you
             Gm
But then you came in and we locked eyes
    C
You kicked the ashtray over as we came toward each other
           Eb
Stubbed my cigarette out against the west wall
D
 And quickly lit another
Gm
Look at that

Would you look at that?
C
 We're throwing off sparks
Gm          F         C          Gm
What will I do when I don't have you
                       Bb    Gm
To hold onto in the dark?

     Gm
Yes, everybody's gonna need a witness
Bb                             Eb
Everybody's gonna need a little back up
                       Gm
In case the scene gets nasty

You throw the attic window open
      Bb                      Eb
And I throw myself all around you
                        Gm
And night comes to Tallahassee
C                                   F
 I don't know why it's gotten harder to keep myself away
Eb
Thought I'd finally beat the feeling back
D
 It all came back today
            Gm
And then we fell down and we locked arms
   C
We knocked the dresser over as we rolled across the floor
Eb
 I don't mean it when I tell you
D
 That I don't love you anymore
Gm
Look at that

Would you look at that?
C
The way the ceiling starts to swerve
Gm          F         C          Gm
What will I do when I don't have you
                             Bb
When I finally get what I deserve?

Gm
