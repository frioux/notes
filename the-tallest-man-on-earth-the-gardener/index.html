** I think his guitar is tuned in open D, with a capo somewhere.
This tab is in standard tuning, with a capo on the 1st fret. **
** Odd verses go G Em C D, even verses go C D G. **


G                       Em      C
  I sense a runner in the garden
                                 D
  Although my judgement's known to fail
G                              Em    C
  Once built a steamboat in a meadow
                          D
  Cos I'd forgotten how to sail


C             D                 G
   I know the runner's going to tell you
C             D                 G
   There ain't no cowboy in my hair
C             D                 G
   So now he's buried by the daisies
C                              D                 G
   So I could stay the tallest man in your eyes, babe


G                       Em      C
I sense a spy up in the chimney
                                 D
From all the evidence I've burned
G                       Em      C
I guess he'll read it in the smoke now
                                 D
And soon to ashes I'll return


C             D                 G
I know the spy is going to tell you
C             D                 G
It's not my flag up in the pole
C             D                 G
So now he's buried by the lilies
C             D                 G
So I could stay forever more in your eyes, babe


G                       Em      C
I sense a leak inside my phone now
                                 D
From all the lies I have told
G                       Em      C
I know he has your private number
                                 D
And soon he'll make that vicious call


C             D                 G
I know the leak is going to tell you
C             D                 G
There ain't now puppy in your leash
C             D                 G
So now he'll fertilize the roses
C             D                 G
So I could stay the king you see


G         C
In your eyes, babe
G         C
In your eyes, babe

G                       Em      C
So now we're dancing through the garden
                                D
And what a garden I have made
G                       Em      C
And now that death will grow my jasmine
                                D
I find it soothing I'm afraid

C             D                 G
Now there is no need for suspicion
C             D                 G
There ain't no frog kissing your hand
C             D                 G
I won't be lying when I tell you
C             D                 G
That I'm a gardner I'm a man


G                       Em      C    D
In your eyes, babe
G                       Em      C    D
In your eyes, babe
G                       Em      C    Em
In your eyes, babe

** Great song. **
