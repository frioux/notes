           <h1>Bob Dylan - Simple Twist of Fate</h1>
<pre><code>...Touching love song about a hooker.

I think he plays it in Open E, but I've provided the song here in STANDARD
TUNING. I think it makes everything easier,  and it sounds great. Enjoy.

Intro : C - Cmaj7 - C7 - F - Fm - C - G - F - C - G - C



C
They sat together in the park
Cmaj7
As the evening sky grew dark,
C7                                      F
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones.
Fm                             C         G         F
twas then he felt alone and wished that hed gone straight
C                       G               C
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.

C
They walked along by the old canal
Cmaj7
A little confused, I remember well
C7                                      F
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin bright.
Fm                             C         G         F
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
C                       G               C
Moving with a simple twist of fate.

C
A saxophone someplace far off played
Cmaj7
As she was walkin by the arcade.
C7                                      F
As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin up,
Fm                             C         G         F
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
C                       G               C
And forgot about his simple twist of fate.

-Harmonica Solo-
(Same Progression)

C
He woke up, the room was bare
Cmaj7
He didnt see her anywhere.
C7                                      F
He told himself he didnt care, pushed the window open wide,
Fm                             C         G         F
Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
C                       G               C
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.

C
He hears the ticking of the clocks
Cmaj7
And walks along with a parrot that talks,
C7                                      F
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailers all come in.
Fm                             C         G         F
Maybe shell pick him out again, how long must he wait
C                       G               C
Once more for a simple twist of fate.

C
People tell me its a sin
Cmaj7
To know and feel too much within.
C7                                      F
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring.
Fm                             C         G         F
She was born in spring, but I was born too late
C                       G               C
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.

Outro is the same, with harmonica.
