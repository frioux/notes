           <h1>Rilo Kiley - A Better Son or Daughter</h1>
<pre><code>This is how I play this song on my acoustic guitar. I put a CAPO on the 4th fret.
It suits my voice nicely, but don't be afraid to move it around to your liking :-)




G                             C             G
Sometimes in the morning i am petrified and can't move
C                G       D
Awake but cannot open my eyes
        G                             C                    G
And the weight is crushing down on my lungs i know i can't breath
    C                 G            D
And hope someone will save me this time
     G                          C          G
Your mother's still calling you insane and high
C             G              D
Swearing it's different this time
        G                          C           G
And you tell her to give in to the demons that possess her
         C        G           D
And that god ever blessed her insides
         G                          C         G
Then you hang up the phone and feel badly for upsetting things
    C               G            D
And crawl back into bed to dream of a time
          G              C            G                 C
When your heart was open wide and you loved things just because
         G            D
Like the sick and the dying

    G                              C               G
And sometimes when you're on you're really fucking on
         C                 G              D
And your friends they sing along and they love you
        G                            C                  G
But the lows are so extreme that the good seems fucking cheap
       C              G            D
And it teases you for weeks in its absense
           G
But you'll fight and you'll make it through
       C              G
You'll fake it if you have to
           C           G           D
And you'll show up for work with a smile
                 G
And you'll be be better you'll be smarter
           C               G
More grown up and a better daughter
   C         G         D
Or son and a real good friend
              G
And you'll be awake and you'll be alert
          C                  G
You'll be positive though it hurts
           C          G               D
And you'll laugh and embrace all your friends
                G
And you'll be a real good listener
          C                G
You'll be honest you'll be brave
          C                  G
You'll be handsome you'll be beautiful
          D
You'll be happy


G,C,G,C,G,D X2

     G
Your ship may be coming in
       C                   G
You're weak but not giving in
       C             G            D
To the cries and the wails of the valley below
     G
Your ship may be coming in
       C                   G
You're weak but not giving in
           C                  G            D
And you'll fight it you'll go out fighting all of them
