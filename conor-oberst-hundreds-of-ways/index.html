Capo 2


(VERSE 1)
G                    C              G
What a thing to be a witness to the sunshine
G                       C              D
What a dream to just be walking on the ground
Em                  D                 C               G
What a time to live among the ash and remnants of our love
G                              D                G
That came before and I'm still looking for that now

G                    C                   G
It took centuries to build these twisted cities
G                  C                   G
It took seconds to reduce them down to dust
    Em                       D                 C                   G
And all the tour guide could say was take your pictures folks its late
G                           D                 G
And try your best please to remember what was done

(PRE-CHORUS)
C
Dont look so forlorn
C                 G
Dont you look so scared
C
Dont get so upset
C                    G
This world was never fair

(CHORUS)
              D
But there are hundreds of ways
   C
To get through the day
          D
There are hundreds of ways
    C
Now you just find one

(VERSE 2)
G                    C               G
I used to think that time was of the essence
G                 C              G
Now I just wish I could get some sleep
         Em                D
All this strange parade of sounds
         C                G
The city makes when I lie down
       G                   D          G
Little explosions that set fire to my dreams

G               C                 G
Sometimes I get mistaken for this actor
      G                C               G
And I guess that I can see it from the side
      Em            D
Maybe no one really seems to be
    C                G
The person that they mean to be
  G            D             G
I hope I am forgotten when I die

(PRE-CHORUS)
C
Dont contradict me
C                       G
Dont make me cross the line
C
If you feel threatened
C                   G
It's only because I might

(CHORUS)
              D
But there are hundreds of ways
   C
To get through the day
              D
But there are hundreds of ways
   C
To get through the day
              D
Yes there are hundreds of ways
   C                G
So you best find one

(CHORUS)
D                     C
All my heroes theyre all talk
D
Running in circles
     C
Some stop, watch, some chaos
D                     C
Love was the message, full stop
   Em     D      C
We ramble on and on
   Em     D      C
We ramble on and on
Hey!

(VERSE 3)
G                           C          G
I stole all the rhinestones out of Carolina
G                C               G
Sold them out in Bakersfield for cash
        Em              D
Now the bandshell had a band
              C         G
Sound like an arcade in Japan
            G                  D
Blew all my quarters trying to get that feeling back

G                       C            G
Now any sucker can turn boredom into violence
G           C           G
A sociopath riding on a bus
        Em         D              C       G
And his irises are black from his novelty contacts
         G                   D               G
He looks around but he cant see the rest of us

(PRE-CHORUS)
C
In my sunglasses
C                       G
Dont mind the blinding light
C
Yeah its getting dark, bro
C                         G
But Ive always loved the night

(CHORUS)
              D
But there are hundreds of ways
   C
To get through the day
          D
There are hundreds of ways
   C
To get through the day
          D
There are hundreds of ways
    C
To get through the day
          D
There are hundreds of ways
   C
To get through the day
          D            D            C
There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of ways
   D
To get through the day
Just find one
G
