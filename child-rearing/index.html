<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<ul>
<li>Survive <em>and</em> thrive: Watch for ways to take the difficult parenting moments
when you’re simply trying to survive, and turn them into opportunities for
your children to thrive.</li>
<li>Integration → Health and success: The brain performs at its best when its
different parts work together in a coordinated and balanced way.  An
integrated brain results in improved decision making, better control of body
and emotions, fuller self understanding, stronger relationships, and success
in school.</li>
<li>The River of Wellbeing: The more integrated our kids are, the more they can
remain in the river of well being, avoiding the bank of chaos on one side, and
the bank of rigidity on the other.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="chapter-1-integrating-the-left-and-right-brain">Chapter 1: Integrating the Left and Right Brain</h4>
<ul>
<li>Left + right = clarity and understanding: Help your kids use both the
logical left brain and the emotional right brain so they can live balanced,
meaningful, and creative lives full of connected relationships.</li>
<li>What You Can Do: Helping your child work from both sides of the brain
<ul>
<li>Connect and Redirect: When your child is ups et, connect first emotionally,
right brain to right brain. Then, once your child is more in control and
receptive, bring in the left brain lessons and discipline.</li>
<li>Name it to Tame It: When big, right brain emotions are raging out of
control, help your kids tell the story about what’s upsetting them. In
doing so, they’ll use their left brain to make sense of their experience
and feel more in control.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="chapter-2--integrating-the-upstairs-brain-and-the-downstairs-brain">Chapter 2 : Integrating the Upstairs Brain and the Downstairs Brain</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be patient with the upstairs brain: Unlike the primitive downstairs brain,
which is intact at birth, the sophisticated upstairs brain is “under
construction” during childhood and adolescence. Plus, it’s especially
vulnerable to being “hi jacked” by the downstairs brain, especially in high
emotion situations. So don’t expect your children to make good decisions all
the time, or to remain in control of their emotions and actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What You Can Do: Helping develop and integrate your child’s upstairs brain</p>
<ul>
<li>Engage, don’t enrage: In high stress situations, engage your child’s
upstairs brain, rather than triggering the downstairs brain. Don’t
immediately play the “Because I said so!” card. Instead, appeal to your
child’s higher order thinking skills. Ask questions, ask for alternatives,
even negotiate.</li>
<li>Use it or lose it: Provide lots of opportunities to exercise the upstairs
brain so it can be strong and integrated with the downstairs brain and the
body. Play “What would you do?” games and present them with dilemmas.
Avoid rescuing them from difficult decisions.</li>
<li>Move it or lose it: When a child has lost touch with his upstairs brain, a
powerful way to help him regain balance is to have him move his body.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="chapter-3-integrating-memory">Chapter 3: Integrating Memory</h4>
<ul>
<li>Make the implicit explicit: Help your kids make their imp licit memories
explicit, so that past experiences don’t affect them in debilitating ways. By
narrating past events they can look at what’s happened and make good,
intentional decisions about how to handle those memories.</li>
<li>What You Can Do: Helping your child integrate implicit and explicit memories
<ul>
<li>Use the remote of the mind: After a painful event, a child may be reluctant
to narrate what happened. The internal remote lets her pause, rewind, and
fast a story as she tells it, so she can maintain control over
how much of it she views.</li>
<li>Remember to remember: Help your kids exercise their memory by giving them
lots of practice at remembering. In the car, at the dinner table, wherever:
help your kids talk about their experiences, so they can integrate their
implicit and explicit memories.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="chapter-4-integrating-the-many-parts-of-myself">Chapter 4: Integrating the Many Parts of Myself</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Wheel of awareness: Sometimes our kids get stuck on one particular point
on the rim of their wheel of awareness, and lose sight of the many other
parts of themselves. We need to give them mindsight, so they can be aware of
what’s happening in their own mind.  Then they can choose where they focus
their attention, integrating the different aspects of themselves and gaining
more control over how they feel.</li>
<li>What You Can Do: Introducing your child to the wheel of awareness
<ul>
<li>Let the clouds of emotion roll by: Remind kids that feelings come and go.
Fear and frustration and loneliness are temporary states, not enduring
traits.</li>
<li>SIFT: Help your children pay attention to the Sensations, Images, Feelings,
and Thoughts within them. They can’t understand and change their inner
experiences until they are first aware of what’s going on inside.</li>
<li>Exercise mindsight: Mindsight practices teach children to calm themselves
and focus their attention where they want.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="chapter-5-integrating-self-and-other">Chapter 5: Integrating Self and Other</h4>
<ul>
<li>Wired for “we”: Watch for ways to capitalize on the brain’s built capacity
for social interaction, especially by being intentional about creating
positive mental models of relationships. Parents and other important
caregivers create children’s expectations about relationships that will
affect and guide them throughout their lives.  Help them develop mindsight,
which offers them insight into themselves as individuals, and empathy for
and connection with those around them.</li>
<li>What You Can Do: Helping your child integrate self and other
<ul>
<li>Enjoy each other: Build fun into the family, so that your kids enjoy
positive and satisfying experiences with the people they ’re with the most.</li>
<li>Connect through conflict: Try not to view conflict as merely an obstacle to
avoid.  Instead, use it as an opportunity to teach your kids essential
relationship skills, like seeing other people’s perspectives, reading
nonverbal cues, and making amends.</li>
</ul>
