IMPORTANT NOTE: When there is a transition from G#-&gt;D#5 or D#5-&gt;G# you often have to pull off
                the 3rd string (for G#-&gt;D#5) or the 2nd string (for D#5-&gt;G#) before
                changing the chord.

A#,G#,D#5,G#,D#5,C#


        A#  G#         D#5
We were travellers, so blind
        G#        D#5       C#
Went to where the world did end
        A#        G#        D#5
Read of deaths in waves and out
           G#      D#5    C#
So this is when we walked away
        A#      G#    D#5
And the sadness I  suppose
      G#      D#5    C#
Gonna hold me to the ground
          A#        G#       D#5
Where I'm forced to find the still
     G#        D#5      C#     (PAUSE)
In a place you won't be 'round


          C#   G#      D#5
Now Was I ever part of knowing
          G#    D#5  C#   (PAUSE)
With your hands in   mine
       C#      G#       D#5     D# (PAUSE)
Little screams into the wonder
                  A#,G#,D#5
And a wild set of rides
         G#,D#5,C#
So c'mon now
    A#,G#,D#5          G#,D#5,C#
Oooooooooooooooh c'mon now



       A#     G#  D#5
And so here I go again
      G#      D#5     C#
Say I want my freedom sure
              A#     G#      D#5
But it's like end of all the dreams
           G#   D#5         C#
Like in my life  I   needed more
         A#      G#    D#5
And this madness I  suppose
      G#       D#5      C#
Gonna haunt me with the line
             A#    G#      D#5
That I could drink until I sleep
            G# D#5  C#     (PAUSE)
Through all scarier times




          C#   G#      D#5
Now Was I ever part of knowing
          G#    D#5  C#   (PAUSE)
With your hands in   mine
       C#      G#       D#5     D# (PAUSE)
Little screams into the wonder
                  G#,D#5,C#
And a wild set of rides
         G#,D#5,C#
So c'mon now
    A#,G#,D#5          G#,D#5,C#
Oooooooooooooooh c'mon now

D#                      C# G#              C# G#      D#5
Now was I ever going to be more than these savages in me
             C#        G#               C#      G#
As they will sing into silence, just to silence tears
    C#      G#      D#5
Now what is left in here?



             A#              G#            D#5
It's not the sting of cities flickering in life no
            G#                D#5           C#
It's not me knowing there's a deeper in the dust no
             A#             G#           D#5
It's not the reasoning with shadows that are gone no
            G#          D#5        C#   (PAUSE)
It's not me knowing I'm yet to see fire
                           A#,G#,D#5
It's just all this fucking doubt
         G#,D#5,C#
So c'mon now
    A#,G#,D#5          G#,D#5,C#
Oooooooooooooooh c'mon now


         A#      G#    D#5
And this sadness I  suppose
      G#      D#5    C#
Gonna hold me to the ground
          A#        G#       D#5
Where I'm forced to find the still
     G#        D#5      C#     (PAUSE)
In a place you won't be 'round
