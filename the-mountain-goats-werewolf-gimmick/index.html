<pre><code>done by Alyeska

Played in standard tuning, and with almost everything barred. Open chords can work,
but don't sound properly harsh in my opinion. Somewhere between a powerchord and the full barre works best.

Intro: Em-F5 x4

Verse 1:

Em                                      A
I was not there for rehearsal, I don't need it anymore
        F#m                                 G                  F#m
When I show up just in time to pop you can clear the goddamn floor
Em                          A
Empty out the locker room, let me find my space
F#m                                       G            B
Let him who thinks he knows no fear look well upon my face

Chorus 1:
           Em         D5
Nameless bodies - in unremembered rooms
      C5          Em            C5        D5       Em
Know how a man becomes a beast when the wolfbane blooms

Verse 2, same as the first:

Em                                A
Sail past all the grasping hands, floodlights white and hot
          F#m                G                 F#m
Bring my vision into focus, find out what I've got
        Em                             A
Some sniveling local babyface with an angle he can't sell
      F#m                              G                   B5
Full werewolf off the buckle, like an angel straight from hell


Chorus 2:
           Em         D5
Nameless bodies - in unremembered rooms
      C5                  Em              C5 D5     Em
Run howling through the carnage when the wolfbane blooms


Bridge:

F                               Em
Half the city sound asleep and safe inside their beds
     D5              C5                 G                 B
Get lost inside my thoughts and nearly tear his face to shreds


Verse 3:

       Em                           A
Blood pooling on the canvas as the atmosphere gets hushed
            F#m                      G                    F#m
Bring your heroes to the wolf den - watch them all get crushed
     Em                         A
Get told to maybe dial it back, backstage later on
     F#m                                    G               B5
Everyone still in this building right now, dead before the dawn


Final Chorus:

Chorus 2:
           Em         D5
Nameless bodies - in unremembered rooms
     C5               G                B5     Em
The pure at heart go putrid when the wolfbane blooms
