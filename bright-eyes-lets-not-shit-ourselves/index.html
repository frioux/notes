I have just Augmented the file so it just contains the chords

and added chords to the rest of the verses.



[Intro]

C, E, Am, F, G x4



C                 E

The animals laugh from the dark of the wilderness.

Am               F       G

baby cries hard in an apartment complex,

C                   E

As I pass in a car buried under the influence.

Am                     F         G

The city's driving me out of my mind.

C                             E

I've seen a child is caught in the sad trap of gravity.

Am                   F                  G

He falls from the lowest branch of the apple tree,

C                          E

And lands in the grass and weeps for his dignity.

Am                      F     G

Next time he will not aim so high.

Am                G           C

Yeah, next time, neither will I.





C                                   E

A mother takes loans out, sends her kids off to colleges.

Am                          F         G

Her family is reduced to names on a shopping list.

C                                      E

Meanwhile, a coroner kneels, beneath a great, wooden crucifix.

Am                                       F       G

He knows that there are worse things than being alone.

C                                   E

So, I've learned to retreat at the first sign of danger.

Am                                F          G

I mean, why wait around, if it's just to surrender?

C                          E

Ambition, I've found, can only lead to failure.

Am         F         G

I do not read the reviews.

Am           G           C

No, I am not singing for you.





C, E, Am, F, G x4.

Am, G, C





C                                   E

I stood dropping a coin into the pit of a well.

Am                                   F                     G

And I would throw my whole billfold if I thought it would help.

C                                      E

With all these wishes I make, I should buy something real,

Am             F           G

At least a telephone call home.

C                              E

Well, my teachers, they built the retaining wall memory,

Am                         F             G

All those multiple choices I answered so quickly.

C                             E

And I got my grades back and forgot just as easily,

Am              F      G

But at least I got an 'A'.

Am               G        C

So I don't have them to blame.





C                               E

I should stop pointing fingers; reserve my judgment

Am                                    F              G

Of all those public action figures, the cowboy president.

C                            E

So loud behind the bullhorn, so proud they can't admit

Am              F       G

When they've made a mistake.

C                          E

While poison ink spews from a speechwriter's pen,

Am                                 F                 G

He knows he don't have to say it, so it don't bother him.

C                                  E

&quot;Honesty&quot; &quot;Accuracy&quot; are really just &quot;Popular Opinion.&quot;

Am                   F       G

And the approval rating's high.

Am                 G     C

And so someone's gonna die.





C                E

Well, ABC, NBC, CBS: Bullshit.

Am                                       F          G

They give us fact or fiction? I guess an even split.

C                          E

And each new act of war is tonight's entertainment.

Am                      F           G

We are still the pawns in their game.

C                                    E

As they take an eye for an eye until no one can see,

Am                                   F             G

And we must stumble blindly forward, repeating history.

C                                             E

Well, I guess that we all fit into your slogan on the fast food marquee:

Am             F                    G

Red blooded, White skinned oh and the Blues.

Am                  G                   C

Oh, and the Blues? I got the Blues! That's me! That's me!





C, E, Am, F, G x4

Am, G, C





C                         E

Well, I awoke in relief.  My sheets and tubes were all tangled.

Am                           F             G

Weak from whiskey and pills, in a Chicago hospital.

C                         E

My father was there, in a chair by the window,

Am         F     G

staring so far away.

C                               E

I tried talking, just whispered, &quot;...so sorry...so selfish...&quot;

Am                          F                G

He stopped me and said, &quot;Child I love you regardless

C                                  E

And there is nothing you could do that would ever change this.

Am              F     G

I'm not angry. It hap-pens.

Am            G             C

But you just can't do it again.





C                          E

So now I try to keep up, I have been exchanging my currency.

Am                       F              G

While a million objects pass through my periphery.

C                              E

So now I am rubbing my eyes because they are starting to bother me.

Am                         F          G

I've been staring too long at the screen.

C                                   E

But where was it when I first heard that sweet sound of humility?

Am                        F                      G

It came to my ears in the goddamn loveliest of melodies.

C                             E

How grateful I was then to be part of the mystery;

Am          F        G

To love and to be loved.

Am               G         C

Let's just hope that is enough.





C, E, Am, F, G x4

Am, G, C
