           <h1>The Mountain Goats - Romans 10:9</h1>
<pre><code>On the DVD, it looks like John is playing the first two lines of the verses as G, Cadd9, D:

 G   Cadd9  D

Because if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.

G C D

G                             C                 D                        G  C  D
Wake up sixty minutes after my head hits the pillow I can't live like this
G                                  C           D                         G   C  D
And in the shower I am a sailor standing ready waiting for the ship to list
Em                                 G
Everything looks burned up I'm too scared to look around
       C                               D
Don't feel like going on but come on make a joyful sound

        G                    C          Em               G
If you will believe in your heart and confess with your lips
           C       D            G
Surely you will be saved one day

Try to think of ways to fix myself but everything ends in a cul-de-sac
The beast broke from the barn while we were sleeping face it face it he's not coming back
Don't see what the point is in event trying to fight
Look for the bigger picture when I close my eyes real tight

If you will believe in your heart and confess with your lips
Surely you will be saved one day

Bm                   Em      F             Em
Look for the sign of Daniel, consider the clues
C                   G                D
Wait as long as I have to for good news

Wake and rise and face the day and try to stop the day from staring back at me
Busy hours for joyful hearts and later maybe head out to the pharmacy
Won't take the medication but it's good to have around
A kind and loving God won't let my small ship run aground

If you will believe in your heart and confess with your lips
Surely you will be saved one day
