Tuning: Standard

The chords used in this song are mostly barre chords, but you can use pretty
much any variation of each chord that you want and it still sounds great.

[Verse 1]

C#m        G#        A          B
  She came in on the red-eye to Dallas-Fort Worth.
E         G#       A         B
  All the way from sunny Taipei.
C#m        G#         A        B
  Skin the color of a walnut shell,
      E           G#       A                B
And a baseball cap holding down her black hair.
             A             B
And she came here after midnight.
E                          A
  The hot weather made her feel right at home.


[Chorus]

        E      A
Come on in, we haven't slept for weeks.
                   E          A                B
Drink some of this, it'll put color in your cheeks.


[Verse 2]

C#m        G#          A    B
  He drove in from Mexicali no worse for wear.
E          G#   A        B
  Money to burn, time to kill, but
C#m    G#      A              B
  Five minutes looking in his eyes and
         E              G#             A          B              A
  We all knew he was broken pretty bad, so we gave him what we had.
                              B
We cleared a space for him to sleep in,
               E
And we let the silence that's our trademark
A
Make its presence felt.


[Chorus]

        E      A
Come on in, we haven't slept for weeks.
                   E          A                B
Drink some of this, it'll put color in your cheeks.


[Interlude]

C#    G#    A    B
E           B


[Verse 3]

C#m         G#        A       B              E
  They came in by the dozens, walking or crawling.
                G#      A
Some were bright-eyed,
          B
Some were dead on their feet.
E          G#           A              B          E
  And they came from Zimbabwe, Or from Soviet Georgia,
           G#             A                 B               A
East Saint Louis, or from Paris, or they lived across the street.
                               B
But they came, and when they'd finally made it here,
           E                         A
It was the least that we could do to make our welcome clear.


[Chorus]

        E      A
Come on in, we haven't slept for weeks.
                   E            A                B
Drink some of this, this'll put color in your cheeks.


[Outro]

E            A
E            A
E            B
C#m    G#    A    B    (x3)
E
