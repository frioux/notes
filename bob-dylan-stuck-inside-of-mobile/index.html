E                    C#m
Oh the rag-man draws circles
E               C#m
Up and down the block.
    E                C#m
I'd ask him what the matter was
      A                  B7
But I know that he don't talk.
        A               E
And the ladies treat me kindly
    C#m             E
And furnish me with tape
    C#m            E
But deep inside my heart
  A              E
I know I can't escape

G#m
Oh Mama,

Can this really be the end?
      E               C#m
To be stuck inside of Mobile,
E        A              E
with the Memphis blues again?

E                              C#m
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley
         E                     C#m
With his pointed shoes and his bells.
E             C#m
Speaking to a French girl,
    A                 B7
Who says she knows me well.
    A              E
And I would send a message
   C#m               E
To find out if she's talked,
        C#m                  E
But the post office has been stolen
        A           E
And the mail box is locked.

G#m
Oh Mama,

Can this really be the end?
      E               C#m
To be stuck inside of Mobile,
E        A              E
with the Memphis blues again?

E                    C#m
Mona tried to tell me
E               C#m
To stay far away from the railroad line.
    E                C#m
She said that all the railroad men
      A                  B7
Drink your blood like wine.
        A               E
An' I said &quot;Oh, I didn't know that
    C#m             E
But then again there's only one I've me
    C#m            E
An' he just smoked my eyelids
  A              E
An' punched my cigarette&quot;

G#m
Oh Mama,

Can this really be the end?
      E               C#m
To be stuck inside of Mobile,
E        A              E
with the Memphis blues again?

E                              C#m
Grandpa died last week
         E                     C#m
And now he's buried in the rock
E             C#m
But everybody talk about
    A                 B7
How badly they were shocked.
    A              E
But me I expected it to happen
   C#m               E
I knew he'd lost control
        C#m                  E
When he built a fire on main street
        A           E
And shot it full of holes.

G#m
Oh Mama,

Can this really be the end?
      E               C#m
To be stuck inside of Mobile,
E        A              E
with the Memphis blues again?

E                    C#m
Now the senator came down here
E               C#m
Showing everyone his gun.
    E                C#m
Handing out free tickets
      A                  B7
To the wedding of his son.
        A               E
An' me I nearly got busted
    C#m             E
An wouldn't it be my luck
    C#m            E
To get caught without a ticket
  A              E
And be discovered beneath a truck

G#m
Oh Mama,

Can this really be the end?
      E               C#m
To be stuck inside of Mobile,
E        A              E
with the Memphis blues again?

E                              C#m
Now the preacher looked so baffled
         E                     C#m
When I asked him why he dressed
E             C#m
With twenty pounds of headlines
    A                 B7
Stapled to his chest
    A              E
But he cursed when I proved to him
   C#m               E
Then I whispered not even you can hide.
        C#m                  E
You see you're just like me
        A           E
I hope your satisfied

G#m
Oh Mama,

Can this really be the end?
      E               C#m
To be stuck inside of Mobile,
E        A              E
with the Memphis blues again?

E                    C#m
Now the rainman gave me two cures
E               C#m
Then he said &quot;Jump right in&quot;
    E                C#m
The one was Texas medicine
      A                  B7
The other railroad gin.
        A               E
An like a fool I mixed them
    C#m             E
An' it strangled up my mind
    C#m            E
An' now people just get uglier
  A              E
An' I have no sense of time.

G#m
Oh Mama,

Can this really be the end?
      E               C#m
To be stuck inside of Mobile,
E        A              E
with the Memphis blues again?

E                              C#m
When Ruthie says come see her
         E                     C#m
In her honkey-tonk lagoon,
E             C#m
Where I can watch her waltz for free
    A                 B7
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
    A              E
An' I say, &quot;Aw come on now
   C#m               E
You must know about my debutante.&quot;
        C#m                  E
An' she says, &quot;Your debutante knows just what you need
        A           E
But I know what you want.&quot;

G#m
Oh Mama,

Can this really be the end?
      E               C#m
To be stuck inside of Mobile,
E        A              E
with the Memphis blues again?

E                    C#m
Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
E               C#m
Where the neon madmen climb
    E                C#m
They all fall there so perfectly.
      A                  B7
It all seems so well timed.
        A               E
An' here I sit so patiently
    C#m             E
Waiting to find out what price
    C#m            E
You have to pay to get out of
  A              E
Going through all these things twice

G#m
Oh Mama,

Can this really be the end?
      E               C#m
To be stuck inside of Mobile,
E        A              E
with the Memphis blues again?
