<pre><code>[Intro]

D A Bm G Em G D

[Verse]

D                 A
Tried some bad meditation
D7                 G
Sittin' up in the dark
D                       A
They say to picture an island
G                           D
'cause that's one place to start
D                           A
I guess I could count my blessings
D7                    G
I don't sleep in the park
Em                    Bm
With all my earthly possessions
G                    A
In one old shopping cart
F#m                  G
No, I'm up in the penthouse
F#m               A
On a big feather bed

[Chorus]

       D  A        Bm G
Is it too late to fixate
Em  G       D
On that instead

[Harmonica]
D A D7 G
D A G  D

[Verse]

D                  A
My wife takes a vacation
D7              G
One she can't afford
D                  A
I go fishin' the alleys
G                 D
For someone to escort
D                     A
No, I don't mind the money
D7                    G
It beats betting on sports
Em                         Bm
And though it might get expensive
G                    A
It's cheaper than divorce
F#m                    G
And I love her torn stockings
F#m                  A
And her lipstick of red

[Chorus]

       D  A        Bm G
Is it too late to fixate
Em  G       D
On her instead

[Bridge]

Em                  Bm
You know you're my favorite
F#m                    G
She says when we're through
Em                  Bm
Some parts are off limits
G                    A
But I'd give them to you

[Violin Solo]
D A D7 G
D A G  D

[Verse]

D                         A
Where the hell was Dock Ellis
D7                   G
When I gave up that hit
D                  A
Where was Timothy Leary
G             D
When reality bit
D                    A
Who's the new Dalai Lama
D7              G
That shy little kid
Em                  Bm
With no room in his body
G                       A
Where a stranger could live
F#m                      G
I can't blame him for dreamin'
F#m                    A
He'll sleep when he's dead

[Chorus]
       D   A       Bm G
Is it too late to fixate
Em  G    Bm
On that instead
       D    A     Em G
Is it too late to fixate
Em    G     D
On that instead

[Outro]
