           <h1>Bob Dylan - One of Us Must Know</h1>
<pre><code>Words and music Bob Dylan
Released on Blonde on Blonde (1966)
Tabbed by Eyolf Ã˜strem

Capo 5th fret (sounding key F major)
The 2nd guitar is probably playing with a capo on the 1st fret and chords in E major

*) If you include the note in the piano here, you would get a Dm/f chord

In the refrain there is a nice bass line that one can get by playing the chords:

C . G/b . |F/a . C/g . |F . C/e . |G

BTW, this is the same line as in the refrain of Sad-Eyed Lady.

C . . F |C . . F |C . . F |C . . .

  C                        F*) C
I didn't mean to treat you so bad
F             C      (F) G(sus4)      G
You shouldn't take it so personal
  C                       F  C
I didn't mean to make you so sad
F        C          (F) G               (Gsus4-G)
You just happened to be there, that's all
Am                                   Em
When I saw you say &quot;goodbye&quot; to your friend and smile
Dm                         C
I thought that it was well understood
Am                             Em
That you'd be comin' back in a little while
Dm                                     F              G
  I didn't know that you were sayin' &quot;goodbye&quot; for good

     C         G      F              C
But, sooner or later, one of us must know
F             C                  G
That you just did what you're supposed to do
C         G      F              C
Sooner or later, one of us must know
F             C              G
That I really did try to get close to you

  C                        F*) C
I couldn't see what you could show me
F             C      (F) G(sus4)      G
Your scarf had kept your mouth well hid
  C                       F  C
I couldn't see how you could know me
F        C          (F) G               (Gsus4-G)
But you said you knew me and I believed you did
Am                                   Em
When you whispered in my ear
Dm                         C
And asked me if I was leavin' with you or her
Am                             Em
I didn't realize just what I did hear
Dm                                     F              G
I didn't realize how young you were

     C         G      F              C
But, sooner or later, one of us must know
F             C                  G
That you just did what you're supposed to do
C         G      F              C
Sooner or later, one of us must know
F             C              G
That I really did try to get close to you

  C                        F*) C
I couldn't see when it started snowin'
F             C      (F) G(sus4)      G
Your voice was all that I heard
  C                       F  C
I couldn't see where we were goin'
F        C          (F) G               (Gsus4-G)
But you said you knew an' I took your word
Am                                   Em
And then you told me later, as I apologized
Dm                         C
That you were just kiddin' me, you weren't really from the farm
Am                             Em
An' I told you, as you clawed out my eyes
Dm                                     F              G
That I never really meant to do you any harm

     C         G      F              C
But, sooner or later, one of us must know
F             C                  G
That you just did what you're supposed to do
C         G      F              C
Sooner or later, one of us must know
F             C              G
That I really did try to get close to you
